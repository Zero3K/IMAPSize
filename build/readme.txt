This is the zipped WANT executable, used for building the whole project. If you don't already have want installed, you will either need to unzip the file and add this directory to your PATH, or copy this exe to the projects root directory (../../) and invoke the build from there.

The build file (want.xml) is located in the root of the project (../../)
